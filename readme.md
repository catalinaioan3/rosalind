## ROSALIND bioinformatic challenges

This project was created with the purpose of learning bioinformatics by solving common tasks, from some more simple to 
more complex ones.

Each file solves one task as they are listed in the Rosalind project, https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/. Some 
of the more complex tasks use methods defined in previous scripts.

Each filename contains the Rosalind problem id in its name. Each python script uses a matching name dataset found in 
the data folder. All output is printed on the screen. 
Detailed information is found inside every script, via docstrings and comments.

Files not linked to a rosalind problem: validations.py 

### Requirements:
1. Python 3.6 or newer
2. pathlib package

### Usage:
